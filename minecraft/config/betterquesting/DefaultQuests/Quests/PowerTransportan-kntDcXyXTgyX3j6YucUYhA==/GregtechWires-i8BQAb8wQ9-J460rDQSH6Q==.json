      "desc:8": "Gregtech wires work differently than other tech mods.  Gregtech 6 wires are available in exposed wires and insulated wires known as cables.  The wires are available in bundles from 1 to 16 wires.  The cables are available is 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, and 16x cables.  Each cable has a maximum volatage (i.e. EU) that the wire/calbe to carry, amperage or the number of machines you can run off that wire/cable at the same time, and loss whic his the number of EU loss per meter of wire/cable.  So you want to check the maximum EU that you need and how many machines you are running to determine your cable that you use.\n\nÂ§e\nWarning:  You can use uninsolated wires at your own risk.  You can be shocked by uninsolated wires and you aare not by the insulated cables.  The insulated cables also have less loss than the wires."
