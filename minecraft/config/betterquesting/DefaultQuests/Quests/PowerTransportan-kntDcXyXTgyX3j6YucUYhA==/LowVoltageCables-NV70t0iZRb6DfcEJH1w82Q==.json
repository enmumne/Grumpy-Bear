      "desc:8": "The wires and cables for Low Voltage (LV) are made from tin.  The wire are exposed so you can shock and damage yourself so you will want to insulate the wires using rubber.  This will result in a cable.  You can make any wire from 1x to 16x but for cables, they only come in 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, and 16x.  For this quest you need to make 8x time cables.  You will need the Laminator to coat the wire in rubber.  T\n§b\nNote:  The number of x\u0027s denmotes how much increase in amps the cable can carry.  A tin cable can carry 1 amp, soi a 8x tin cable can carry 8 amps.  All wores and cable has a loss per each cabl;e/wire used.  Using cables reduces this loss.  You also wat to use a cable that carry enough amps to run your machines.  The capacity is determine by the number of batteries in a battery box, the number of machines being used, or both.  So using a large Battery box wit h8 batteries and running 5 machines will melt your 4x cables.\n§a\nTo complete this quest craft:\n4 4x Tin Cable -OR-\n2 8X Tin Cables"
